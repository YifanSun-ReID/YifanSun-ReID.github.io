career-profile:
    title: Short Bio
    summary: |
      I am a <b>second-year PhD student</b> at the College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University,
      where I am supervised by <a href = "http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~sgould/" target="_blank">Stephen Gould</a>
      and <a href = "http://liangzheng.com.cn/" target="_blank">Liang Zheng</a>.
      Befor that, I received the M.Eng. from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019, advised by Prof. Jianbin Jiao. I obtained the B.Eng.
      from Beijing Jiaotong University in 2016, advised by Dr. Jupeng Li.

      <b>Research interest </b> my general research interest is to develop deep learning model for computer vision tasks (e.g., fine-grained object recognition).
      Recently, I focus on the dataset bias, understanding the model decision under novel environments. Please check our [<a href = "https://weijiandeng.me/AutoEval" target="_blank">recent CVPR 2021 work</a>].
